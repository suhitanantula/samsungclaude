# Podcast Booking Strategy
## How to Get 20+ Guest Appearances in 90 Days

**Goal**: Appear on 20+ podcasts in 3 months to build authority and audience before McKinsey notices the pattern.

**Reality Check**: Podcasts are NOT the hardest channel - they're actually one of the easiest IF you have the right approach. Most podcasts desperately need good guests with interesting stories.

---

## Why Podcasts Want You

### The Host's Problem:
- Need 50-100 episodes per year
- Struggle to find interesting guests
- Want guests who bring new angles
- Need people who can tell stories (not just share frameworks)
- Want guests who will promote the episode

### What You Have That They Want:
1. **Unique angle**: F1 + AI (no one else has this combination)
2. **Compelling story**: Discovery narrative (you found what McKinsey missed)
3. **Broad appeal**: F1 brings non-business audiences
4. **Timely topic**: AI is hot, organizational design is relevant
5. **Promotional value**: You'll share to your growing audience

**Bottom Line**: You're not asking for a favor. You're offering value to hosts who need content.

---

## The Three-Tier Podcast Strategy

### Tier 1: Easy Wins (Week 1-2)
**Target**: Smaller podcasts (1K-10K listeners) that will say yes immediately

**Why Start Here**:
- Build confidence and practice your pitch
- Get testimonials ("guests say I'm a great host")
- Create video/audio samples for bigger pitches
- Often more engaged audiences than mega-podcasts
- Hosts become advocates (refer you to others)

**How to Find**:
- Search "AI podcast" + "organizational design podcast" on Apple/Spotify
- Filter by 10-100 episodes (established but not huge)
- Look for podcasts that interview guests (not solo shows)

**Examples**:
- "The AI Business Podcast"
- "Leading with Data"
- "Digital Transformation Podcast"
- "Future of Work Podcast"
- Industry-specific podcasts in target sectors

**Pitch Difficulty**: 80% acceptance rate
**Time to Book**: 1-2 weeks
**Target**: 5-8 bookings in first 2 weeks

---

### Tier 2: Mid-Size Growth (Week 3-6)
**Target**: Established podcasts (10K-100K listeners) with engaged audiences

**Why These Matter**:
- Significant audience reach
- Good credibility boost
- Often have production quality for video clips
- Hosts have industry connections

**Examples**:
- "The Knowledge Project" (Shane Parrish)
- "The Prof G Pod" (Scott Galloway)
- "Invest Like the Best" (Patrick O'Shaughnessy)
- "The Tim Ferriss Show" (long shot but worth trying)
- "Masters of Scale" (Reid Hoffman)
- Industry leaders in your target sectors

**Pitch Difficulty**: 30-50% acceptance rate
**Time to Book**: 3-8 weeks
**Target**: 8-10 bookings in weeks 3-8

---

### Tier 3: Aspirational Big Wins (Week 4-12)
**Target**: Major podcasts (100K+ listeners) for massive reach

**Why These Are Hard But Possible**:
- Very selective about guests
- Usually need warm introductions
- Long booking lead times (2-6 months)
- But your F1 angle makes you interesting

**Examples**:
- "Lex Fridman Podcast" (F1 angle helps)
- "How I Built This" (Guy Raz)
- "Acquired" (Ben Gilbert & David Rosenthal)
- "a16z Podcast"
- "HBR IdeaCast"

**Pitch Difficulty**: 5-10% cold acceptance, 50%+ with warm intro
**Time to Book**: 2-6 months
**Target**: 2-3 bookings in first 6 months

---

### Bonus Tier: F1-Adjacent Podcasts

**The Secret Weapon**: F1 podcasts give you mainstream credibility

**Why This Works**:
- They rarely cover AI/business angles
- You bring fresh perspective to F1 audience
- F1 fans are affluent, professional decision-makers
- Creates unusual positioning ("the guy who explains F1 AI on business podcasts")

**Examples**:
- "Beyond the Grid" (F1's official podcast)
- "Shift+F1" (F1 for newcomers)
- "The Race F1 Podcast"
- "Missed Apex Podcast"
- "WTF1 Podcast"

**Pitch Angle**: "The hidden AI revolution in Formula 1 that no one's talking about"

**Pitch Difficulty**: 40-60% acceptance (you're offering novel angle)
**Target**: 3-5 bookings

---

## The Pitch That Works

### The Email Template (Tier 1-2)

**Subject Line Options**:
- "Guest pitch: What Formula 1 knows about AI that McKinsey doesn't"
- "Story idea: The hidden pattern in F1 and telecom networks"
- "Guest for [podcast name]: F1 + AI + organizational design"

**Email Body**:

```
Hi [Host Name],

I've been binging [Podcast Name] - your episode with [specific guest] on [specific topic] was brilliant, especially when they said [specific quote/insight].

I have a story I think your audience would find fascinating:

While researching organizational design, I discovered that Formula 1 teams and telecommunications companies have independently evolved identical architectures for human-AI collaboration - and no one has noticed this pattern, including McKinsey and HBR.

**The Story**:
- Hannah Schmitz (Red Bull F1 strategist) makes 500-millisecond decisions processing 1.1M data points/second
- Neither human expertise nor AI alone could compete
- Meanwhile, Ericsson telecom is building the exact same architecture at network scale
- They've never coordinated, yet arrived at identical solutions
- This is convergent evolution in organizational systems

**Why Your Audience Would Care**:
- Shows what co-intelligence actually looks like in practice (not theory)
- Reveals why traditional AI transformation frameworks fail
- Provides frameworks listeners can use in their own organizations
- F1 story is visceral and accessible, telecom proves it at scale

**What We Could Discuss**:
- The Miami GP 2023 decision that demonstrates human-AI collaboration
- Why business literature completely missed this pattern
- The 8 universal principles that apply across industries
- How to assess if your organization is ready for co-intelligence

**About Me**:
[2-3 sentences: your background, why you're qualified, any credibility markers]

I can record in high quality from [your location]. Happy to work around your schedule.

Would this be interesting for [Podcast Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - I'm happy to send you the full framework PDF ahead of time if you want to dig deeper.
```

**Why This Works**:
1. **Opens with genuine engagement** (you listened, you can cite specifics)
2. **Hook is immediate** (F1 + McKinsey missed it)
3. **Story is clear** (convergent evolution is inherently interesting)
4. **Value is obvious** (useful for their audience, not just promotional)
5. **Makes hosting easy** (you handle tech, flexible scheduling)

---

### The Pitch for Tier 3 (Bigger Shows)

**Key Difference**: Need warm introduction OR exceptional timing

**Warm Intro Strategy**:
1. Identify past guests you can reach (LinkedIn, mutual connections)
2. Send them your free PDF first
3. Ask: "If you found this valuable, would you be willing to introduce me to [host]?"
4. They make intro, you follow up with detailed pitch

**Cold Pitch Enhancement** (if no warm intro):
- Open with news hook: "With [recent AI development], the question isn't whether organizations will become co-intelligent, but whether they'll do it intentionally..."
- Lead with media credibility: "I'm speaking at [conference] and publishing in [publication]..."
- Demonstrate authority: "My research has been adopted by [business school/company]..."

---

- Follow up within 24 hours

**Content Path** (build demand):
- Publish viral article
- Tag Tier 3 hosts in discussion
- They reach out to YOU

---

## Making the Recording Easy (So They Say Yes)

### Technical Setup

**Audio Quality** (Critical):
- **Minimum**: Good USB microphone ($50-100)
- **Recommended**: Audio-Technica ATR2100x or Samson Q2U
- **Ideal**: Shure MV7 or SM7B setup
- Quiet room, soft surfaces (avoid echo)

**Video Setup** (Many podcasts do video now):
- **Minimum**: Laptop webcam with good lighting
- **Recommended**: External webcam (Logitech C920) + ring light
- **Ideal**: DSLR camera setup
- Clean background or bookshelf

**Software**:
- Zoom (most common)
- Riverside.fm (higher quality)
- SquadCast (backup option)
- Always test beforehand

**Why This Matters**: Hosts reject guests with poor audio. Good setup = higher acceptance rate.

## Overcoming Common Objections

### "We already covered AI"
**Response**: "This isn't about AI technology - it's about organizational architecture. The angle is convergent evolution: two industries independently arriving at identical solutions. It's more biology than technology."

### "Our audience isn't technical"
**Response**: "Perfect - neither is my approach. I lead with the F1 story because it's human drama: split-second decisions at 300 km/h. The AI is invisible, which is exactly the point. Your audience will relate to the organizational challenges, not the technology."

### "We don't cover sports"
**Response**: "I'm not pitching a sports story - F1 is the case study for organizational design under extreme conditions. The same patterns apply to finance, healthcare, retail. F1 is just the most visible example of co-intelligence in action."

### "We have a long booking queue"
**Response**: "I completely understand. My research is timely because McKinsey and others will catch this pattern soon - I'd love to get this story to your audience first. But I'm also happy to wait if the timing works better in [3 months]. Would that work?"

### "Can you send more information?"
**Response**: "Absolutely - I'll send my one-sheet plus the free Framework PDF so you can see the depth of the research. I'm also happy to jump on a 15-min call if you want to discuss episode angles."

- Got buried in your inbox (happens!)

If it's option 3, I'd love to discuss. If it's 1 or 2, no worries at all - I'll keep listening and supporting [Podcast Name].

Best,
[Your Name]

## Advanced Tactics for Maximum Impact

### Podcast Tours (Geographic)
When you book 3-4 podcasts that record in-person in same city:
- Schedule all recordings in same week
- Fly there for "podcast tour"
- Post about it ("In [city] this week recording 4 podcasts...")
- Creates buzz and FOMO

### Cross-Promotion Strategy
When you appear on multiple podcasts:
- Ask each host if you can mention other appearances
- "I just talked about this with [other host] on [their show]"
- Creates network effect
- Hosts appreciate cross-pollination

### The Controversy Hook (Use Carefully)
For harder-to-book podcasts:
- Lead with contrarian take
- "Why McKinsey's AI Framework Will Fail"
- "The Death of the Data Scientist"
- "AI Transformation is a Myth"
- Gets attention, but must be defensible

### The News Hook
When something F1 or AI related is trending:
- Immediate outreach to relevant podcasts
- "Given [recent news], thought your audience might be interested in..."
- Timely pitches get priority

### The Referral Ask
After every successful recording:
- "This was great - who else should I talk to?"
- "Are there other podcasts you'd recommend?"
- "Would you be willing to introduce me to [specific host]?"
- Hosts often become advocates

## Measuring Success

### Vanity Metrics (Don't Obsess)
- Number of appearances
- Total potential reach
- Social media mentions

### Real Metrics (Focus Here)
- Email list growth from episodes
- Free PDF downloads with source tracking
- Premium purchase conversions
- Speaking invitations from listeners
- Warm intros to bigger platforms

### Relationship Metrics (Long-term Value)
- How many hosts refer you to others
- How many want you back for follow-up episodes
- How many become content partners
- How many join your community

---

## The Secret Weapon: Going First

**Counter-Intuitive Truth**: Everyone wants to be on Lex Fridman or Tim Ferriss first.

**Your Strategy**: Go on 15 Tier 1 podcasts FIRST.

**Why This Works**:
1. You practice and improve with every recording
2. You collect testimonials and clips
3. You figure out what resonates
4. By the time you pitch Tier 3, you're polished
5. You have proof (social proof from other appearances)

**Most People Do This Wrong**: They pitch big shows first, get rejected, give up.

**You Do This Right**: Build momentum from bottom up, become unstoppable by the time you reach the top.

---

## Month 1 Action Plan (Podcast Focus)

### Week 1:
- **Day 1**: Create podcast tracking spreadsheet
- **Day 2**: Build Tier 1 target list (50 podcasts)
- **Day 3**: Create guest one-sheet
- **Day 4**: Record intro video and audio samples
- **Day 5**: Send first 10 Tier 1 pitches
- **Day 6-7**: Send 10 more pitches

### Week 2:
- **Day 1-3**: Send final 30 Tier 1 pitches
- **Day 4-5**: Follow up on Week 1 pitches
- **Day 6-7**: Schedule recordings with yes responses

### Week 3:
- **Day 1-2**: First recordings (3-4 podcasts)
- **Day 3-4**: Build Tier 2 target list (30 podcasts)

- **Day 6-7**: More recordings (3-4 podcasts)

### Week 4:
- **Day 1-2**: More recordings (4-5 podcasts)
- **Day 3-5**: Send remaining Tier 2 pitches
- **Day 6-7**: Schedule recordings, prepare for next month's wave

**Expected Results After Month 1**:
- 80 total pitches sent
- 40 yes responses (50% rate)
- 20 recordings completed
- 20 more scheduled for Month 2
- First episodes start launching Week 5-6

---

## Why This Works (The Psychology)

### For Small Podcasts:
They say yes because you're offering value they need (interesting guest with novel angle).

### For Medium Podcasts:
They say yes because you have proof (appearances on other shows, engaged audience, quality content).

### For Large Podcasts:
They say yes because you have momentum (social proof, media mentions, warm intros from trusted sources).

### For F1 Podcasts:
They say yes because you're offering an angle they've never covered (AI/business perspective on racing).

**The Compounding Effect**: Each appearance makes the next one easier to book.

**The Timeline**:
- Weeks 1-4: Effort feels high, results feel low
- Weeks 5-8: First episodes drop, momentum builds
- Weeks 9-12: Snowball effect, hosts reach out to YOU

**Trust the Process**: If you send 50 pitches to Tier 1 podcasts with the template I provided, you WILL get 25-30 yes responses. It's a numbers game at that tier, and you have a strong pitch.

---

## Final Tips

### Do:
✅ Listen to at least one episode before pitching
✅ Reference specific moments in your pitch
✅ Make it about their audience, not you
✅ Follow up (most people don't)
✅ Be professional but personable
✅ Promote episodes enthusiastically when they launch
✅ Thank hosts publicly and privately

### Don't:
❌ Send generic mass pitches
❌ Pitch before having good audio setup
❌ Forget to follow up
❌ Over-pitch yourself (story > credentials)
❌ Ghost after recording
❌ Fail to promote episode
❌ Pitch shows you haven't listened to

---

## The Bottom Line

**Podcasts are NOT hard if you**:
1. Have a unique, interesting story (you do: F1 + telecom convergent evolution)
2. Start with achievable targets (Tier 1, not Lex Fridman)
3. Do the unglamorous work (50 personalized pitches)
4. Follow up consistently (most people give up)
5. Deliver value to hosts and listeners (you will)

**Your first 20 podcast appearances will come from**:
- 15 from Tier 1 (smaller shows that say yes easily)
- 3-4 from Tier 2 (medium shows that see your momentum)
- 1-2 from F1 podcasts (novel angle for them)
- 0-1 from Tier 3 (but the pipeline is building)

**By Month 3**:
- You'll have been on 25+ podcasts
- Downloaded episodes will drive 5,000+ email subscribers
- You'll have video/audio content library
- Bigger shows will start reaching out to YOU
- You'll be THE voice on co-intelligence before McKinsey notices

**Start today. Send 10 pitches tomorrow. This is doable.**
