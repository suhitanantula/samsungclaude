## 1. Key Concept Mappings

### 1.1 Core Definition Alignment

**Ericsson's AI Native Definition:**
> "AI native is the concept of having intrinsic trustworthy AI capabilities, where AI is a natural part of the functionality, in terms of design, deployment, operation, and maintenance."

**Co-Intelligent Organisation Mapping:**
- **Intrinsic Integration**: Maps directly to co-intelligence's principle of AI as embedded organizational capability rather than bolt-on technology
- **Natural Part of Functionality**: Aligns with the co-intelligent concept of AI as organizational "nervous system" rather than external tool
- **Lifecycle Integration**: Reflects co-intelligence's holistic approach to AI integration across all organizational processes

### 1.2 Architectural Concepts

| Ericsson AI Native Concept | Co-Intelligent Organisation Principle |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Intelligence Everywhere | Distributed Cognitive Architecture |
| Distributed Data Infrastructure | Organizational Memory Systems |
| Zero-Touch Operations | Autonomous Organizational Functions |
| AI as a Service (AIaaS) | Intelligence Platform Economy |

The telecom industry's AI native journey **strongly validates** several Co-Intelligent Organisation principles:

1. **Pervasive Intelligence Works at Scale**: Telecom networks demonstrate that distributed AI can function in massive, critical infrastructure
2. **Evolution Path is Universal**: The progression from augmentation to native intelligence appears consistent across domains
3. **Human Governance Remains Essential**: Even in highly automated systems, human oversight and goal-setting remain crucial
4. **Trust is Non-Negotiable**: Industry adoption requires trustworthy, explainable AI

### 5.2 Extensions to the Framework

The telecom case suggests several extensions to Co-Intelligent Organisation:

1. **Infrastructure Criticality Dimension**: Need to account for different requirements based on system criticality
2. **Regulatory Navigation**: More emphasis on regulatory compliance in co-intelligence evolution
